# MFMA Visualization Test Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Main Issue: "Could not get instructions for cdna2"
**Root Cause**: The MatrixCalculator class was constructing incorrect paths when running commands from the calculator's directory, resulting in doubled directory paths.

**Fix Applied**: Modified the `run_command` method in `MatrixCalculator` to:
- Separate directory and filename
- Use only the filename when running from the calculator's directory
- Set the correct working directory for command execution

### 2. BF16 Instruction Support
**Observation**: The `v_mfma_f32_16x16x8bf16` instruction correctly shows only 8 K columns for matrix A (not 16).

**Test Added**: Created `test_matrix_a_layout_bf16` to verify:
- Matrix A has 16 rows (M=16) 
- Matrix A has 8 K columns (K=8)
- Correct bf16 bit range patterns ([15:0] and [31:16])
- Proper register/lane mappings

## Current Test Status
- ✅ Calculator availability tests pass
- ✅ Instruction list retrieval works
- ✅ Instruction details parsing works
- ✅ Register notation parsing works
- ✅ F16 matrix layout tests pass
- ✅ BF16 matrix layout tests pass
- ✅ Register count verification passes
- ✅ Table formatting tests pass

## Key Files Modified
1. `mfma_viz_simple.py` - Fixed the path handling in MatrixCalculator.run_command()
2. `test_mfma_viz.py` - Added test case for bf16 instruction layout

## Verification
The Streamlit app is running successfully at http://localhost:8501 and correctly displays:
- All supported architectures (cdna2, cdna3, etc.)
- Complete instruction lists
- Accurate register layouts for all matrix types (A, B, C, D)
- Correct handling of different data types (f16, bf16, f32, etc.)
- Proper display of K dimensions (16 for f16, 8 for bf16, etc.)
